ROot-BAsed Simulator for ray Tracing (ROBAST)

1. About
ROBAST is a non-sequential ray-tracing simulator program which is based on the ROOT framework. ROBAST fully utilizes its 3D geometry library to offer several functionalities required for ray-tracing simulations of cosmic-ray telescopes. 

The advantages of using ROBAST are
- Easy to build complex telescope geometries using TGeo* and AGeo* classes
- Runs on both OS X and Linux
- Scriptable in C++ and Python
- Easy to learn even if you could not be a Geant4 expert
- Direct analysis of simulation results in ROOT
